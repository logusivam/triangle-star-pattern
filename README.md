# Triangle Star Pattern in C++

This project demonstrates how to print a triangle star pattern in C++. The pattern is formed by printing asterisks (*) in a triangular shape, where each row contains an increasing number of asterisks.

## Features

- **Triangle Star Pattern**: Prints a triangle shape using asterisks.
- **Simple and Efficient**: Uses basic C++ constructs for loop-based pattern printing.

## Installation

To use this project, simply download or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/logusivam/triangle-star-pattern.git
```

Alternatively, you can directly copy the `main.cpp` file into your project directory.

Usage
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang, devcpp).

2. Navigate to the project directory and compile the code:
```
g++ main.cpp -o triangle_star_pattern
```

3. Run the compiled executable:
```
./triangle_star_pattern
```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of rows for the triangle.

# Example
Here is an example of the triangle star pattern:
```
Enter the number of rows for the triangle: 5
